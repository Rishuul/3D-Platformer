This is my first Unity3D project and I am still learning and adding new things to my game. This game is inspired by the famous game "Red Ball" and I intend to add new scoring systems,
new powerups, mechanics like double jump, anti gravity. I will be making a lot more projects in the near future. I decided to make my first project public so I uploaded it to GitHub.
